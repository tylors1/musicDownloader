I created this to help automate the process of fetching meta data for my music files.

After installing dependencies, enter the song and artist of a song you'd like to download. The script finds a high definition file 
from YouTube with a web scrape and downloads it using youtube-dl. Using the Spotipy library and Beautiful Soup for scraping Wikipedia, 
the script attempts to fill in metadata for the track downloaded.
